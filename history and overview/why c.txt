There is a quote
   "C is the language your language is written on."


It is used as the reference language for computer science 
courses all over the world

Today, C is widely used in embedded devices,
 and it powers most of the Internet servers,
    which are built using Linux. 
The Linux kernel is built using C, 
  and this also means that C powers the core of all Android devices. 
We can say that C code runs a good portion of the entire world.


C is strongly-typed language
 you have to assign memory to variable on your own.
Failing to do so generates error.

Many people think this makes C harder than most of the language 
like Python.
But in my opinion If you are new to Computer Science you should 
know basic concepts like memory allocations, Python gives you 
privilage to not learn this but in the long run these things are 
essential.
