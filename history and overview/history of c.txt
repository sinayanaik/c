C is a structured programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1973 at Bell Laboratories.


Dennis Ritchie
born September 9, 1941
dead October 2011,
bachelor’s degree (1963) in physics
doctorate (1968) in mathematics from Harvard University.
1967 - joined Bell Labs


C language was developed to write the UNIX operating system, hence it is strongly associated with UNIX,


UNIX
UNIX, multiuser computer operating system. UNIX is widely used for Internet servers, workstations, and mainframe computers.
In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer
Linux is a Unix-Like Operating System(note: unix like not unix)
macOS adopted the Unix kernel


C language has evolved from three different structured language ALGOL, BCPL and B Language


Structured programming
Structured programming is a subset of procedural programming.
   It is also known as modular programming
   The structured programming language allows a programmer to code a program by dividing the whole program into     
   smaller units or modules.


In 1988, the language was formalised by American National Standard Institute(ANSI). In 1990, a version of C language was approved by the International Standard Organisation(ISO) and that version of C is also referred to as C89.
Programs written in C language takes very less time to execute and almost executes at the speed of assembly language instructions.


Latest Version of C
The current latest version of C language is C11, which was introduced in 2011. It is supported by all the standard C language compilers.
