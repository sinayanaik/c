continue statement
 On encountering continue, execution leave the current cycle of loop(Iteration), and starts with the next cycle.


Without continue statement a loop:


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
   {
       printf("%d\n",i);
   }
   printf("Loop ended\n");
}
	

It will give output
PS C:\Users\sinay\Desktop\git\c\5. Jumping out of loop> ./break
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Loop ended
	

By using continue; statement


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
        
        if(i==5){
            continue;
        }
        
        printf("%d\n",i);
    }
    printf("Loop ended\n");
}


this would give output
PS C:\Users\sinay\Desktop\git\c\5. Jumping out of loop> .\continue.exe
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10
Loop ended
	

Here the loop where 5 was to be printed was skipped because of continue; statement
