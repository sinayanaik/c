if condition statement into a short and simple operator

general syntax: 

expression 1 ? expression 2: expression 3

The question mark "?" in the syntax represents the if part.

The first expression (expression 1) generally returns either true or false,
  based on which it is decided whether (expression 2) will be executed 
  or (expression 3)

If (expression 1) returns true
  then the expression on the left side of " : " i.e (expression 2) is executed.

If (expression 1) returns false 
  then the expression on the right side of " : " i.e (expression 3) is executed.
