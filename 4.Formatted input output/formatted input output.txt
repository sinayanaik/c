We can also limit the number of digits or characters that can be input or output,
 by adding a number with the format string specifier, like "%1d" or "%3s", 

the first one means a single numeric digit and the second one means 3 characters,

hence if you try to input 56, while scanf() has "%1d", 
        it will take only 5 as input.

But in case of output(printf())

if
  int x = 6;

  printf("%3d",x); 
  will print:  6
  Two blank spaces before 6
  because in format specifier it has been specified 3 digits but there are not 
  enough digits so it will fill the remaining with blank spaces


In case of Floating Point numbers 
   we can also specify how many digit we want to print after decimal point

 float x = 4.53235;
 
 printf("%f.4',x));
 will print: 4.5323

 But you can't use %f.n with scanf in Floating point numbers
