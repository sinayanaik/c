2. **Time yourself (30-45 minutes per problem)**
3. **Explain your thought process**
4. **Consider multiple approaches**
5. **Handle edge cases**

### **For Assessment**
1. **Complete exercises without looking at solutions**
2. **Compare your approach with provided solutions**
3. **Identify areas for improvement**
4. **Track your progress over time**

## üîß Tools and Setup

### **Compilation Commands**
```bash
# Basic compilation
gcc -o program source.c

# With warnings (recommended)
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o program source.c

# With debugging information
gcc -g -o program source.c

# With optimization
gcc -O2 -o program source.c
```

### **Testing Your Code**
```bash
# Compile and run
gcc -Wall -o exercise exercise.c
./exercise

# Test with different inputs
echo "test input" | ./exercise

# Use valgrind for memory checking
valgrind ./exercise
```

## üìà Progress Tracking

### **Daily Practice (30-60 minutes)**
1. **Warm-up** (5 min): Review previous concepts
2. **New Exercise** (20-30 min): Solve one new problem
