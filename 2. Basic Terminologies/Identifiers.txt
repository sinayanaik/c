Informally we can say Identifiers = variables 

In C language identifiers are the names given to 
      variables, 
      constants, 
      functions, 
      user-defined data.

RULES:
1.An Identifier can only have alphanumeric characters(a-z , A-Z , 0-9) 
        and underscore(_)
2.The first character of an identifier can only contain 
        alphabet(a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
3.Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. 
 For example, var and Var are two different identifiers in C
4. Keywords are not allowed to be used as Identifiers.
5.No special characters, 
  such as a semicolon, period, whitespaces, slash, or comma
  are permitted to be used in or as an Identifier.
  (except underscore(_)).
