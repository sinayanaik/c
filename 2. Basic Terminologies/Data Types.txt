Data types specify
   how we enter data into our programs 
   and what type of data we enter

Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold.

C language has some predefined set of data types
 to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program.

C language supports 2 different type of data types:

Primary data types:
These are fundamental data types in C
 namely integer(int), floating point(float), character(char) and void.

Derived data types:
Derived data types are nothing but primary datatypes but
  a little twisted or grouped together 
like array, stucture, union and pointers.


1.Integer type

Integers are used to store whole numbers.

TYPE                             SIZE                                              VALUE RANGE

int	                    2 or 4 bytes	                            -32,768 to 32,767 or 
                                                                     -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

unsigned int 	            2 or 4 bytes	                                  0 to 65,535 or
                                                                                  0 to 4,294,967,295

short	                      2 bytes	                                    -32,768 to 32,767

unsigned short                2 bytes                                             0 to 65,535

long			      8 bytes or 4bytes                -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

unsigned long	              8 bytes	                                          0 to 18446744073709551615


2.Character type

Character types are used to store characters value. 

CHARACTER maybe alphabets(a,b,c,d,e.....A,B,C,D,.....),Numbers(1,2,3,4.....),special characters(!,@,#,$...)
but the important thing is they should be enclosed within single quotation mark ('')
like :  'A','#','1'

characters are only allowed to be single digit long 
  correct: 'A'
  incorrect: 'ABC' because there are three characters inside the quotation mark


Type	       Storage size	        Value range
char	        1 byte	              -128 to 127 or
                                         0 to 255

unsigned char	1 byte	                 0 to 255

signed char	1 byte	              -128 to 127

3.Floating point type

Floating types are used to store real numbers(Both fractional and whole).

Type	            Storage size	  Value range	       Precision

float             	4 byte	    1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38	           6 decimal places
double	                8 byte	   2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308	          15 decimal places
long double	      10 byte	  3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932	  19 decimal places

                             (NOTE:  1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38	= 1.2 * 10^-38 to 3.4 * 10^+38 )

4. void type

void type means no value. 
This is usually used to specify the type of functions which returns nothing.
