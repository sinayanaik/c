C Keywords:
Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the C language.
The meaning of C language keywords has already been described in the C compiler. 

These meanings cannot be changed. 
   Thus, keywords cannot be used as Variables names because
 that would try to change the existing meaning of the keyword, 
which is not allowed. 

There is a total of 32 keywords in the C language.
