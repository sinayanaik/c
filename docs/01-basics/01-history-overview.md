# History and Overview of C Programming Language

## Introduction

C is a structured programming language developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1973** at Bell Laboratories. It has become one of the most influential programming languages in computer science history.

## Dennis Ritchie - The Creator

- **Born**: September 9, 1941
- **Died**: October 2011
- **Education**: 
  - Bachelor's degree (1963) in physics
  - Doctorate (1968) in mathematics from Harvard University
- **Career**: Joined Bell Labs in 1967

## Purpose and Development

C language was developed to write the **UNIX operating system**, making it strongly associated with UNIX systems.

### UNIX Operating System

UNIX is a multiuser computer operating system widely used for:
- Internet servers
- Workstations  
- Mainframe computers

**Key Facts:**
- Created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
- First version developed on a PDP-7 minicomputer
- Linux is a Unix-like operating system (note: Unix-like, not Unix)
- macOS adopted the Unix kernel

## Language Evolution

C language evolved from three different structured languages:

1. **ALGOL**
2. **BCPL** 
3. **B Language**

## Structured Programming

Structured programming is a subset of procedural programming, also known as **modular programming**.

**Characteristics:**
- Allows programmers to divide programs into smaller units or modules
- Promotes code organization and reusability
- Improves program readability and maintenance

## Standardization

- **1988**: Language formalized by American National Standard Institute (ANSI)
- **1990**: Version approved by International Standard Organization (ISO)
- **C89**: Also referred to as ANSI C

## Performance

Programs written in C language:
- Execute very quickly
- Run at speeds comparable to assembly language instructions
- Provide excellent performance for system-level programming

## Latest Version

The current latest version of C language is **C11**, introduced in 2011. It is supported by all standard C language compilers.

## Why Learn C?

1. **Foundation**: Understanding C helps learn other programming languages
2. **System Programming**: Essential for operating systems and embedded systems
3. **Performance**: High-performance applications and real-time systems
4. **Portability**: Code can run on different platforms with minimal changes
5. **Industry Standard**: Widely used in software development industry

## Key Features

- **Procedural**: Step-by-step execution
- **Structured**: Modular programming approach
- **Portable**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Efficient**: Close to hardware, fast execution
- **Flexible**: Low-level and high-level programming capabilities
