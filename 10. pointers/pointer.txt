Whenever a variable is defined in C language,
 a memory location is assigned for it,
     in which it's value will be stored.
 We can easily check this memory address, using the & symbol.

 Let us assume that system has allocated memory location 80F for a variable a.

int a = 10;
We can access the value 10 either by using the
   variable name a or by using its address 80F.


Since the memory addresses are also just numbers, 
     they can also be assigned to some other variable.
The variables which are used to hold memory addresses are called Pointer variables.  


Declaration of C Pointer variable

datatype *pointer_name;

The data type of the pointer 
 and the variable to which the pointer variable is pointing
 must be the same.


int a = 10;
int *ptr;       //pointer declaration
ptr = &a;       //pointer initialization
